# Kapi E-Commerce

This repository is a practice full-stack project for building an e-commerce platform called Kapi.
The goal is to simulate an online store experience and practice working with React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MySQL (database).

Project Description

Kapi is designed as a sample coffee e-commerce website, where users can browse products, add items to a cart, and manage their profiles.
The project serves as a playground for learning modern full-stack development, experimenting with UI/UX design, and practicing database integration.
